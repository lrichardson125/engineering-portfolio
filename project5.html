        <p class="above">I am currently working towards a secondary master's in computer science with a specialization in computational perception & robotics from the Georgia Institute of Technology.  I have taken courses in Artificial Intelligence for Robotics, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Embedded Software Optimization.  These are the various projects that I have worked on.</p>

            <h2>Kalman Filter & Particle Filter</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                In Artificial Intelligence for Robotics, one of the assignments was to create a 2D missile defense algorithm that could anticipate the positions of falling meteors and prioritize the order in which to shoot them down.  This was done using a Kalman filter.  In another project, particle filters were used to locate an orbiting satellite and transmit a signal to its home planet in a known orbit.

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                In another project, A* search was used so that a robot could navigate a warehouse to retreive one or more boxes and return them to a specified goal location.

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                In another project, SLAM was used to allow a drone to navigate a 2D map to retrieve a treasure at a specified location, while avoiding trees.
