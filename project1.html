        <p class="above">MIDI is an engineering consulting firm that specializes in medical devices, but occassionally takes on projects in other industries.  During my time at MIDI, I had the opportunity to contribute to the mechanical design of a household combined heat and power (CHP) system, a wearable biometric sensor for veterinary use, and an imaging device for early cancer detection.  In addition, I designed and built a realistic cardiac / respiratory phantom that was used for evaluating the biometric sensor for vet use.  These projects are still under an NDA so I am unable to add additional details at this time. </p>
