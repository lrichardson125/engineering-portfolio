        <p class="above">MIDI is an engineering consulting firm that specializes in developing medical devices from the ground up, but occassionally takes on projects in other industries as well.  During my time at MIDI, I had the opportunity to contribute to and / or lead the mechanical design of a household combined heat and power (CHP) system, a wearable biometric sensor for veterinary use, and an imaging device for early cancer detection.  In addition, I designed and built a realistic cardiac / respiratory phantom that was used for evaluating the biometric sensor for veterinary use.  These projects are still under an NDA so I am unable to add additional details or images at this time. </p>

            <h2>Combined Heat and Power (CHP) System</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                The combined heat and power (CHP) system was a device for residential use that could provide household electricity and hot water from a natural gas engine.  The natural gas engine was used to turn a generator that could provide power directly to a home or to a battery bank and the exhaust heat from the engine was used to heat water stored in a hot water tank.  This allowed the system to be highly energy efficient.  On the CHP system, I was responsible for the design of electronics enclosure assembly.  This was a large sheetmetal enclosure containing a high power inverter along with many other large electronics with high heat dissipation.  I was responsible for all mechanical design on this assembly, which included a high air flow active cooling system.  In addition, I conducted CFD simulations on the assembly using Solidworks simulation to validate my design choices.  This product was also required to comply with UL 2200 for Stationary Engine Generator Assemblies.

            <h2>Biometric Vet Sensor</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                At MIDI, I worked on a collar-worn veterinary device and family of products used to track a pet's biometric data.  This product consisted of the sensor device with a collar-mount clip and a handheld device, as well as a single and gang charger.  For the sensor itself, I generated over a dozen different collar attachment concepts for the client before settling on a single concept.  The other products were all designed to have a similar aesthetic and were designed in Solidworks using surface modeling tools.  Renderings were generated for these concepts using Solidworks PhotoView 360 and functional prototypes were created using rapid prototyping.  In addition, I designed and built an affordable cardiac / respiratory phantom that could simulate a dog's respiratory and circulatory systems both individually and simultaneously.  This allowed for efficient and repeatable data capture that could be used by another member of the team in training a learning model.  I also contributed to some data analysis using traditional filtering techniques in MATLAB and Python.

            <h2>Early Cancer Detection Device</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                On the early cancer detection device, I was responsible for component selection (MIPI camera module, etc.), as well as mechanical design of the housing to allow for adequate airflow and cooling of internal components.  I also performed CFD analysis using Solidworks Simulation to compare the effect of an active vs a passive cooling solution on the internal and surface temperatures of the device.  The device was designed in accordance with IEC 60601-1.
