        <p class="above">Source Ray is a company that manufactures OEM x-ray source blocks for clients in a range of different industries as well as portable x-ray systems.  During my time at Source Ray, I contributed to the mechanical design of two new source blocks in addition to an upgrade on one of the portable x-ray systems.</p>

            <h2>SR130 Upgrade</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                While at Source Ray, an upgrade to the existing SR130 portable x-ray system was undertaken.  During this project, I was involved in redesigning many of the sheet metal components and weldments to allow for the use of an updated laptop and x-ray panels.

            <h2>OEM Source Blocks</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                While at Source Ray, I also worked on the mechanical design of two new OEM source blocks: the 1 kW, 160 kV XRS-160-6.25K-HE and the smaller 40 W, 80 kV SB-80-500.  I designed many of the sheetmetal components, which were lead-lined to maintain x-ray leakage below an acceptable threshold.  I also ensured the design was compiant with IEC 60601-1 and conducted risk analysis / FMEA.
